# JobScraper

## Project Description
**JPWP_Project** is an application designed to scrape job offers from websites like pracuj.pl and justjoin.it, developed as part of the "High-Level Programming Languages" (JPWP) course. The project leverages the **Selenium** library for browser automation and **JavaFX** for building a graphical user interface. Its purpose is to assist users in collecting and reviewing job offers in an automated and intuitive way.

## Features
- Automated scraping of job offers from dynamic websites using Selenium.
- User-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with JavaFX.
- Ability to define search parameters, such as job title or location.
<!-- - Display of collected job offers in a clear format within the application.-->

## How to Run the Project
To run the project on your machine, follow these steps:
 **Soon**
<!--1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bilusss/JPWP_Project
   ```
2. **Ensure you have installed:**
   - **JDK** (Java Development Kit) version 8 or higher
   - **Maven** for dependency management
3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd JPWP_Project
   ```
4. **Build the project using Maven:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   java -jar target/jobscraping-1.0.jar
   ```

**Note:** Ensure that your Java and Maven environments are properly configured and that you have an internet connection, as Selenium requires network access to function.-->

## Technologies and Dependencies
The project is built using the following technologies:
- **Java**: The primary programming language used in the project.
- **Selenium**: A library for browser automation, responsible for data scraping.
- **JavaFX**: A framework for creating the graphical user interface.

Learn more about the technologies here:
- [Selenium Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)
- [JavaFX Documentation](https://openjfx.io/)

## Using the Application
After launching the application, a GUI window will open where you can:
1. Enter search parameters (e.g., job title, location).
2. Start the scraping process by clicking the appropriate button.
3. View the collected job offers within the application.

## Limitations
- The application was created for educational purposes and may not work in future as websites can change their code.
- Performance depends on the structure and availability of the scraped websites.

## Author
The project was created by **[bilusss](https://github.com/bilusss)** and **[ocharek](https://github.com/ocharek)** as part of the JPWP course.
